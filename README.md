📌 About the Snowball Method
The Debt Snowball Method is a strategy where you pay off the smallest loan first while making minimum payments on larger debts. As each loan is paid off, the extra amount rolls over to the next loan, accelerating the debt-free journey.

💡 Plan your debt repayment and achieve financial freedom faster!
